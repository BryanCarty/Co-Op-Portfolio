## Welcome :)

Welcome to my portfolio website.

My name is Bryan Carty. I'm currently a computer science student at the University Of Limerick.

Below, you will find my skills, interests and the projects I've partook in during my academic career. 
### Personal Statement

I like to pride myself on being a highly motivated and hardworking individual. Such traits can be seen in my excellent exam results.

Junior Cert results: (7A'S,3B'S,1C). Note: These were the best results in my school that year.

Leaving Cert results: (556 points). Note: These were the third best results in my school that year.

	String output="";
//Algorithm Description	
	for(int loop=0; loop<spreadsheet.length; loop++) {
		if((index-1)==loop&&positionCounter>1){
			for(int l=loop; l<spreadsheet.length-1; l++) {
				spreadsheet[l]=spreadsheet[l+1];
			}
			positionCounter--;
			spreadsheet[spreadsheet.length-1]=new String();
			output = spreadsheet[loop];
		}	
	}
	return output;
}



public static int move(String from, String to, boolean before) {
//Data Description
	SpreadsheetUtilityMethods UtilityMethodsObject = new SpreadsheetUtilityMethods();
	boolean inList1 = UtilityMethodsObject.onList(spreadsheet, from);
	boolean inList2 = UtilityMethodsObject.onList(spreadsheet, to);
	int indexFrom = UtilityMethodsObject.indexOf(spreadsheet, from);
	int indexTo = UtilityMethodsObject.indexOf(spreadsheet, to);
	String temp = spreadsheet[indexFrom];
	int output = -1;
//Algorithm Description
	if(from!=to && inList1==true && inList2==true) {
		if(before==true) {
			for(int loop = indexFrom; loop<indexTo-1; loop++) {
				spreadsheet[loop]=spreadsheet[loop+1];
			}
			spreadsheet[indexTo-1]=temp;
			output = indexTo-1;
		}else {
			for(int loop = indexFrom; loop<indexTo; loop++) {
				spreadsheet[loop]=spreadsheet[loop+1];
