## Welcome :)

Welcome to my portfolio website.

My name is Bryan Carty. I'm currently a computer science student at the University Of Limerick.

Below, you will find my skills, interests and the projects I've partook in during my academic career. 
### Personal Statement

I like to pride myself on being a highly motivated and hardworking individual. Such traits can be seen in my excellent exam results.

Junior Cert results: (7A'S,3B'S,1C). Note: These were the best results in my school that year.
Leaving Cert results: (556 points). Note: These were the third best results in my school that year.

I look forward to continuing the same degree of academic success throughout my third level education.

My eventual career goal is to become a fully-qualified and experienced software developer, with the longer-term aspiration of starting my own business.
